      title: "What is Digital Carbon?",
      content: "Every time you load a webpage, data travels through servers, networks, and devices — all powered by electricity. The carbon footprint of the internet accounts for roughly 2% of global CO₂ emissions, comparable to the airline industry.\n\nData centers alone consume about 1% of the world's electricity. Each page view, each video stream, and each cloud storage operation contributes to this footprint.\n\nKey facts:\n• The average webpage produces ~0.5g CO₂ per view\n• Streaming one hour of video emits ~36g CO₂\n• A single email with attachments can produce 50g CO₂",

      title: "How Websites Generate Emissions",
      content: "Website emissions come from three main sources:\n\n1. **Data Transfer** — The more data sent from server to user, the more energy consumed. Large images, videos, and heavy JavaScript bundles are the biggest culprits.\n\n2. **Server Processing** — Every request requires CPU cycles on the server. Complex database queries and server-side rendering add to the energy cost.\n\n3. **Client-Side Processing** — Heavy JavaScript execution on the user's device drains battery and uses CPU power, translating to energy consumption.\n\nThe key insight: lighter websites = less energy = lower emissions.",

      title: "Measuring Your Carbon Footprint",
      content: "Several models exist for calculating website carbon:\n\n• **Sustainable Web Design (SWD) Model** — Used by ClimaCode. Estimates CO₂ based on data transfer, energy intensity of the grid, and whether the hosting uses renewable energy.\n\n• **CO2.js Library** — An open-source tool by The Green Web Foundation. It implements the SWD model and makes calculations accessible to developers.\n\nTo measure your site:\n1. Calculate total page weight (HTML + CSS + JS + images + fonts)\n2. Estimate annual page views\n3. Apply the SWD model formula\n4. Compare against benchmarks (median: ~0.5g CO₂/view)",

      title: "Taking Action: First Steps",
      content: "You don't need to rebuild your entire site to make a difference. Start with these high-impact actions:\n\n1. **Audit first** — Use ClimaScan to understand your baseline.\n2. **Optimize images** — Images typically account for 40-60% of page weight. Convert to WebP/AVIF, compress, and lazy-load.\n3. **Reduce JavaScript** — Audit your bundles. Remove unused libraries.\n4. **Choose green hosting** — The Green Web Foundation maintains a directory of hosts powered by renewable energy.\n5. **Set a carbon budget** — Aim for under 0.5g CO₂ per page view.\n\nCongratulations! You've completed Module 1. 🎉",

      title: "Why Images Matter for Carbon",
      content: "Images are the largest contributor to page weight — typically 40-60% of total bytes transferred. A single unoptimized hero image can weigh 2-5 MB.\n\nEvery extra byte means more energy for:\n• Server storage and processing\n• Network transmission\n• Client-side decoding and rendering\n\nOptimizing images is the single highest-impact action you can take to reduce your website's carbon footprint.",

      title: "Lazy Loading & Responsive Images",
      content: "Don't load what users don't see:\n\n• **Lazy loading** — Add loading=\"lazy\" to images below the fold. The browser loads them only when they're about to enter the viewport.\n\n• **Responsive images** — Use srcset to serve appropriately sized images:\n  - Mobile: 400px wide\n  - Tablet: 800px wide\n  - Desktop: 1200px wide\n\nA 1200px image on a 400px phone wastes 67% of data!\n\n• **Aspect ratio** — Always set width and height attributes to prevent layout shifts.",

      content: "CSS also has a carbon cost:\n\n• **Purge unused CSS** — Tools like PurgeCSS or Tailwind's built-in purging remove unused styles.\n• **Avoid CSS-in-JS at scale** — Runtime CSS generation adds JS overhead. Prefer static extraction.\n• **Use CSS custom properties** — One definition, many uses. Smaller file size than repeated values.\n• **Minimize specificity wars** — BEM or utility-first approaches produce cleaner, smaller CSS.\n\nAverage CSS savings from purging: 80-95% reduction!",

Lowest energy cost.\n• **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** — Computed per request. Heavier on the server but great for dynamic content.\n• **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)** — Shifts work to the user's device. Can drain mobile batteries.\n• **ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)** — Hybrid: mostly static with periodic rebuilds.\n\nChoose SSG whenever content allows.
